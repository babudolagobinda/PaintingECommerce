                                Art is as artist does or is it the other around ?
                                Art is a medium for me to explore the different sides to life as well as the many facets I possess.
                                There are no constraints to be a certain way when it comes to painting.
                                It gives me the freedom to be contrary .
                                It has changed me , has taught me that everything can be sublime,
                                the allure is in the eyes of viewer who sees separately form the one who has created it ,
                                and that is most important for humans as understanding is important for us but it is enhanced and limited by our nature, our senses .
                                Still, we strive , for that ideal. I want to understand that striving through my art .
                                Foremost, my attempt is to explore the relation between the creator and the creation since my art belongs to me as much I belong to it.
